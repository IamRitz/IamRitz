I am a recent M.Tech graduate in Cyber Security from IIT Delhi, with a deep interest in safeguarding digital infrastructures. My expertise spans areas like cryptography, network security, ethical hacking, and blockchain. I enjoy working on complex challenges such as threat analysis, secure system design, and incident response, and I’m driven by the ever-evolving nature of cybersecurity.

At the same time, my skills aren’t limited to cybersecurity alone. I have a strong background in software development, with experience in programming languages like Python, C/C++, and Java, along with embedded systems. I’ve had the opportunity to work on projects that blend both fields, such as integrating custom instructions into RISC-V architecture and sensor interfacing with STM32.

I’m excited about opportunities where I can apply both my cybersecurity and software development skills, whether in securing systems or creating innovative software solutions.
